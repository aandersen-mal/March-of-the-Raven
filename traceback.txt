I'm sorry, but an uncaught exception occurred.

While running game code:
  File "game/intro.rpy", line 9, in script
    "As the day is finally drawing to an end, I enter my room and close the door behind me."
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 114, in _window_auto_callback
    _window_show(auto=True)
  File "renpy/common/000window.rpy", line 69, in _window_show
    renpy.with_statement(trans)
IOError: Couldn't find file 'The Fall.mp3'.
